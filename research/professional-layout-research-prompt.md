**Research Focus Areas:**
- Professional custom furniture shop layouts and efficiency studies
- Cabinet manufacturing workflow organization research
- Industrial engineering principles for workshop layout
- Small shop adaptations of professional techniques
- Industry benchmarks for layout efficiency metrics
- Zone separation and material flow optimization studies

**Requirements:**
- Focus on quantified efficiency metrics and measurements
- Include professional shop size ranges and productivity data
- Provide specific distance measurements and space percentages
- Include trade-off analyses (efficiency vs. setup time, etc.)
- Source professional studies and industry research
