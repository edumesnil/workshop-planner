- [x] Storage density and workflow optimization
- [x] Basement workshop considerations (213" × 103" template)
- [x] Mobile tool space savings and flexibility analysis

## Knowledge Base Development ✅ COMPLETED

### Data Transformation Strategy
**Approach**: Transform JSON research findings → TypeScript constraint functions

**Current State:**
- ✅ JSON research files completed (`src/data/research/*-findings.json`)
- ✅ ConstraintFactory to generate executable constraints from JSON
- ✅ TypeScript types for constraint system

**How it works:**
1. JSON stores raw research data (clearances, distances, priorities)
2. ConstraintFactory reads JSON at build time
3. Generates TypeScript constraint objects with `evaluate()` functions
4. Engine executes constraints on tool positions, returns scores

### File Structure (Updated)
