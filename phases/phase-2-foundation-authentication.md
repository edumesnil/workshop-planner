# Phase 2: Foundation & Authentication

**Duration**: Week 2-3
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Overview

Establish the technical foundation with Supabase integration, authentication system, and enhanced navigation. This phase creates the data layer and user management system required for all subsequent features.

## Prerequisites from Phase 1
- ‚úÖ Project setup and dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Research data structure defined
- ‚úÖ Constraint system implemented with mobile tool support
- ‚è≥ Default workshop template created

## Supabase Configuration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Project Setup
- [x] Create Supabase project
- [x] Configure environment variables in `.env.local`
- [x] Set up database connection and test connectivity
- [x] Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### Database Schema Creation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Full schema:** `database-schema.sql` (423 lines)

**Tables created:**
- `user_profiles` - User preferences with constraint weights (40/25/20/15)
- `workshops` - Workshop dimensions and constraints (JSONB)
- `tools` - User tools with mobile support (`is_mobile`, `deployed_position`, `parked_position`)
- `tool_templates` - Public tool library (8 default tools seeded)
- `layouts` - Optimization results with multi-objective scoring

**Key features:**
- ‚úÖ JSONB structure matches TypeScript interfaces exactly
- ‚úÖ Mobile tool dual-position system (deployed vs parked)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies for complete data isolation
- ‚úÖ Validation constraints on dimensions, clearances, power
- ‚úÖ Indexes for performance (<500ms query target)
- ‚úÖ Auto-updating timestamps with triggers

### Database Migrations ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create initial schema file (`database-schema.sql`)
- [x] Run schema on Supabase project via SQL Editor
- [x] Verify table creation and constraints
- [x] Set up RLS policies for user data isolation
- [x] Seed 8 default tool templates

## TypeScript Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Database Types
- [x] Update `src/types/database.ts` with mobile tool fields
- [x] Add `is_mobile`, `deployed_position`, `parked_position` to ToolRow/Insert/Update
- [x] Add `ToolTemplateRow`/Insert/Update interfaces
- [x] Complete type safety for all 5 tables

### Supabase Service Layer
- [x] Update `src/services/supabase.ts` with typed client
- [x] Add `db.toolTemplates` helpers (getAll, getByCategory)
- [x] Add `db.userProfiles` helpers (get, create, update)
- [x] Type-safe CRUD operations for all tables
- [x] Auth helpers (signUp, signIn, signOut, onAuthStateChange)
